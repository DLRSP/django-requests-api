Django's application to provide simple and shared requests client.

---

## Requirements

These packages are required:

-   Python 3.8+ supported.
-   Django 3.2+ supported.

We **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of each Python and Django series.


## Installation

1. Install from **pip**:
```shell
pip install django-requests-api
```

2. Modify `settings.py` by adding the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    "requests_api",
    # ...
)
```

## Usage

```shell
from requests_api import RequestsApi

client = RequestsApi("https://api.publicapis.org")
r = client.get("/entries")
print(r.json())

github = RequestsApi("https://api.github.com", headers={"Authorization": "token abcdef"})
r = github.get("/user", headers={"Accept": "application/json"})
print(r.text)
```
